# Olympic Competitions and Medal Management System 🏅

This project is a **console-based application developed in C++** for the *Algorithms* course.  
The system provides comprehensive management of Olympic-style sports competitions, including secure access, competition simulation, and advanced statistics with historical medal tables.

## 🚀 Main Features

- **Custom Security System**  
  Access is controlled using a student ID (legajo) and a dynamically generated password based on a specific numeric algorithm.

- **Persistent Data Management**  
  Uses binary files to store and retrieve the `archivoCompetencia` structure, which contains information about **87 different sports**.

- **Competition Simulation**  
  Randomly generates the number of participants (between 4 and 16 countries) for each discipline, ensuring no duplicate countries within the same competition.

- **Advanced Statistics Module**
  - Medal tables by country and by sport
  - Overall ranking using a weighted medal points system
  - Podium search using filters (e.g., initial letter of the sport)
  - Console pagination for improved data visualization and user experience

## 🛠️ Technical Details

The project follows a **modular design** to improve readability and maintenance:

- **`main.cpp`**  
  Controls the main program flow and navigation menus.

- **`funcionesTp.cpp` / `funcionesTp.h`**  
  Core business logic, data processing, validations, and structure handling.

- **`deportes.cpp` / `paises.cpp`**  
  Static data sources containing **87 Olympic sports** and **196 countries**.

- **`Tp algoritmos.zpr`**  
  Project configuration file for the **Zinjai IDE**.
